# Configure for DocWorks

This Bash profile script is intended to automate the configuration of documents in a Pivotal
repository for use in a Markdown Project in DocWorks.

Work has barely begun on it. It's more of an idea than a tool right now.
If you can code at all and you're familiar with the migration process, please consider contributing.
