# Configure for DocWorks

This Bash profile script is intended to automate the configuration of documents in a Pivotal
repository for use in a Markdown Project in DocWorks.

Work has barely begun on it. If you can code at all and you're familiar with the 
[migration process](https://confluence.eng.vmware.com/display/CSOT/End-to-end+Migration+Scenario), 
please consider contributing.
