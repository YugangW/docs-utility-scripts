All The Things Image!

The all_the_things_image folder holds an omnigraffle image(s) that initialize(s) the tracking of visual information. The scope of the document is broad, including how cloud foundry works, what are the component parts, and further details down to the level of message passing, or the diego auction process, for example.

The goals of this document are several:

• To have a very large document (or smaller series of documents, as omnigraffle expertise increases) from which parts of it can be selected and exported to support written documentation for a particular topic (Diego Auction);
• Serve as an instructional internal tool/workspace for the docs team to build a model of the moving and critical parts of cloud foundry and its relative ecosphere;

How to Use:

• Add to the image!
• Ideally the image is much bigger, not sure how to do so (12/9/15)
• Create a (separate) stencil for use to build images
