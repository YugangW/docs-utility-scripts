This repo contains useful scripts to help with the Pivotal Cloud Foundry docs team's workflow.

Add the stuff in stuff_to_add_to_bash_profile to your bash profile to enable some useful terminal commands.

Put comment_out_all_repos_except.rb in your ~/bin/ folder so that the 'coare' terminal command can execute its function.

run passive_finder.rb in your workspace directory (or a repo directory) to generate a list of all instances of passive voice contained in all topics nested in that directory.
